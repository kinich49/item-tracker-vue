# item-tracker-vue

Welcome to Item tracker! This my first attempt at creating a vue app from scratch! 
This project was created with vue cli v 4.2.2

The intention of this project is to satisfy my need to keep track of my week-to-week shopping, such as groceries and stuff. This way I can visualice price increments, and be able to make better purchase decisions. 

If you want to use this project for yourself, feel free to fork it. You can also fork the backend, which is located in another repo. 

Feel free as well to report any bug or enhacement.

I hope you can forgive my lack of UX skills.
